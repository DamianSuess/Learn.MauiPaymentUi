# Sample Payment App UI

As the title says, this is a sample credit card payment screen is written using .NET MAUI and the [Prism Library](https://github.com/PrismLibrary) which runs on Windows, Android, iOS, and Tizen.

The sample app leverages [Prism.MAUI](https://github.com/PrismLibrary/Prism.Maui) for its easy-to-use Navigation Service for passing information and Dependency Injection with DryIOC. The sample also makes use of XAML Behaviors, dynamic styling, and shared PNG resources.
