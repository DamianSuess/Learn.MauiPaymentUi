# Sample Payment App UI

As the title says, this is a sample credit card payment screen written using .NET MAUI and the [Prism Library](https://github.com/PrismLibrary) which runs on Windows, Android, iOS, and Tizen.

The sample makes use of [Prism.MAUI](https://github.com/PrismLibrary/Prism.Maui) for navigation and passing information and borrows concepts from the CrossGeeks' [Xamarin.Forms sample](https://github.com/CrossGeeks/PaymentUISample).
